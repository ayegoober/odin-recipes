<h1>Teriaki Chicken! Yosha!!!</h1>

<img src="img/teriaki-chicken.jpg">

<h2>So sweet and salty with a beautiful glazed color. Absolutely delicious over rice.
    Perhaps with some sesame seeds added. Simple, yet elegant. 
</h2>

    <p>The sauce can be made or bought. It's very easy to make but I won't be teaching that.
        I just felt like mentioning it because it really is wuite simple. And we must use
        chicken thighs. The dark meat is so much more complimentary to this dish. Much more tender.
