<h1>Eggcake! :D</h1>

<h2>Great for a easy meal in the morning or a simple dinner. The Frittata! 
    You know, I personally called these eggcakes before I realized I'd been making
    a frittata all along. And I didn't figure that out as I was putting together this page.
    No sir, I did not. These can be made as simply or as complex as you want. Go crazy.

    <p>It recquires eggs. Surprise. Maybe some cream, some salt and pepper
        and maybe some other crazy seasonings. You can cut up meat or veggies as well.
        Think of it like a flat omelette. Just throw whatever you have at it. It'll likely 
        turn out quite alright.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>dash of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cream or H&H</li>
        <li>cheese to sprinkle on top</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Whish the eggs with the salt, pepper, and cream/H&H</li>
        <li>Put the skillet on low heat and pour in the mixture</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and leave for five minutes. If the cake starts rising, it's done.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and place your cheese on top. Cover again and leave until melted.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is the most basic version. You can add whatever you like to 
        the initial mixture. Bacon, pork, chopped onion, shredded potato, etc.
        The eggcake is your oyster. I think.
