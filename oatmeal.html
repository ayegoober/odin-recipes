<h1>Oatmeal</h1>

<img src="../img/oatmeal.jpg">

<h2>A great way to start the day as you mull over where to strike lightning or what woman
    to chase after. It warms your heart and belly and puts a smile on your face. 
</h2>

    <p>You'll place a half cup of oatmeal in a bowl with 1 cup of water, then microwave 
        for two minutes. If you burn hands upon removing the bowl, you've done well. 
        You'll have wanted to chop of some apples while awaiting your scalding bowl. 
        You will drop these in (they should be small dices) along with a tbsp of
        brown sugar, 2 tbsp of half and half and a dash of salt.
